            the type to be nonchalant. But you push your hair under your ears. I
            see your dimples subtly above your lips. Right as I close the door
            behind me, the evening sun resumes gently basking in your face which
            is perfectly tilted to the right. I almost feel bad for interrupting
            whoever was painting this beautiful scene. At the same time I get
            the urge to capture it because I’ve never seen someone who made the
            sun look so good. I forget what I came for but I doesn’t matter
            anymore cuz I would be mad not to take a peak at your name tag But
            somehow it feels like I’ve known you forever. You have a great taste
            in music, you are the type to go to a concert alone, you don’t have
            lots of friends not because you don’t want them but most people
            aren’t interesting enough to keep you interested. You’re artsy even
            though you don’t think you aren’t. You laugh a lot but don’t smile
            enough. You have layers to you, I can tell. Beneath those radiant
            eyes, there’s a nerdy edge to you. Do you read a lot? Watch a lot of
            film? Or is it anime? You think you’re boring but you would probably
            make me blush without trying. I can already see you getting mad at
            me cuz I wasn’t listening to you. I’m sorry, I was mesmerized at how
            you use your hands whenever you describe anything and how your
            eyebrows shoot up when you realize I was spaced out but I really
            can’t help it because you remind me of the ocean in the late summer
            as the sun is setting into the water. I have countless of words
            prepared to say when I get a chance at the front of the line but I
            know I will be short of words even though I’ve always been good with
            them. I grab a mango popsicle for the seventh time this week as I
            walk towards you, interrupting the sun yet again I’m not sorry this
            time.</b
