        </button>
        <b class="you-just-finished"
          >You just finished posting a poem. This is your first time signing it
          with your “W”. You’re exhilarated because one of friend happens to
          like it. Not only like, but she felt it. And that’s all that matters.
          You feel over the moon right now, don’t worry you wrote a lot more. So
          much more, not to brag but you even published a poetry book. And even
          more people liked that one. I know you thought it would feel so good
          but it passed, you barely remember it. Maybe because you always got a
          lot on your preoccupied mind now or maybe the blue nights caught up
          faster than you thought. Well now I know why, but I can’t spoil
          everything for you. Either ways, you’re about to feel some really deep
          feelings, you’ll feel empty some days, other days you’ll be bitter and
          tired but most days you will never want to get up. It’s okay, this one
          will pass too. Just like they all do. There will be more just so you
          know. But don’t be scared, it was scary at first but I promise they’re
          your friends. They help you make so much art. Let me cut this short, I
          know you don’t have the attention span. If you’re seeing this it might
          be one of those blue nights for you, it is for me which is why I can
          confidently say, you’ll be okay kid. I’m friends with them now. Keep
          reading if you want me to show you how.</b
