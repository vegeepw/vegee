            You just finished posting a poem. This is your first time signing it
            with your “W”. You’re exhilarated because one of friend happens to
            like it. Not only like, but she felt it. And that’s all that
            matters. You feel over the moon right now, don’t worry you wrote a
            lot more. So much more, not to brag but you even published a poetry
            book. And even more people liked that one. I know you thought it
            would feel so good but it passed, you barely remember it. Maybe
            because you always got a lot on your preoccupied mind now or maybe
            the blue nights caught up faster than you thought. Well now I know
            why, but I can’t spoil everything for you. Either ways, you’re about
            to feel some really deep feelings, you’ll feel empty some days,
            other days you’ll be bitter and tired but most days you will never
            want to get up. It’s okay, this one will pass too. Just like they
            all do. There will be more just so you know. But don’t be scared, it
            was scary at first but I promise they’re your friends. They help you
            make so much art. Let me cut this short, I know you don’t have the
            attention span. If you’re seeing this it might be one of those blue
            nights for you, it is for me which is why I can confidently say,
            you’ll be okay kid. I’m friends with them now.
