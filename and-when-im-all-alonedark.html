        </div>
        <b class="you-just-finished"
          >You just finished posting a poem. This is your first time signing it
          with your “W”. You’re exhilarated because one of your friend happens
          to like it. Not only like, but she felt it. And that’s all that
          matters. You feel over the moon right now, don’t worry you wrote a lot
          more. So much more, not to brag but you even published a poetry book.
          And even more people liked that one. I know you thought it would feel
          so good but it passed, you barely remember it. Maybe because you
          always got a lot on your preoccupied mind now or maybe the blue nights
          caught up faster than you thought. Well now I know why, but I can’t
          spoil everything for you. Either ways, you’re about to feel some
          really deep feelings, you’ll feel empty some days, other days you’ll
          be bitter and tired but most days you will never want to get up. It’s
          okay, this one will pass too. Just like they all do. There will be
          more just so you know. But don’t be scared, it was scary at first but
          I promise they’re your friends. They help you make so much art. Let me
          cut this short, I know you don’t have the attention span. If you’re
          seeing this it might be one of those blue nights for you, it is for me
          which is why I can confidently say, you’ll be okay kid. I’m friends
          with them now. Keep reading if you want me to show you how.</b
