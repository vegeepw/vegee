            I don’t know why they won’t get more help. If we could just get a
            couple more hands on this, I know mere kids with brain bigger than
            those sheriffs combined. But it’s an evil world we live in. The ones
            with the brains do jobs meant for the brawn. Wasting away good
            brain. Like Rosa, she took my order down without putting pen to
            paper and even did the math in her head. I reckon she could help
            solve one or two of these cases. Everything served by her hand is so
            delicious even though I don’t like the food. I could go back today,
            After Bedford.

            "Oh Bedford" It’s the third one now, well that we know of. But
            Bedford is a different ground, not even close to the first two ones.
            We could have two killers? The method of killing are very similar, I
            haven’t seen the body in Bedford but M told me it’s the same, blunt
            force trauma to the skull and throat slash, Ear to ear. but they are
            far apart enough to be one person. What kind of women are they, I
            need to see the Bedford body. Those poor damsels. What fucks me up
            the most? This bastard is a brother. The truth everyone else is
            perhaps too bewildered to utter. I for one am relieved though they
            call me a mad man, if this be a white man, we will eternally be
            bounded… worse identified with him. And God help us who live on pain
            because he will be our god all over again. So I rejoice we hurt
            ourselves. At least it is we who hurt us. And It is we who will lick
            our wounds when pain is gone.

            "Well, I'm almost sure he's a brother. I place him middle aged. Late
            thirties to early forties. He’s fairly built. Well above average
            height. In other sense quite an attractive man. He's also smart.
            Therefore his job is respectable. Also high income. In addition to
            that, it's admirable or high profile. He's someone we all might have
            seen. Someone we all like. Think our friendly mailman, cop,
            firefighter, family doctor, teacher. I won't even cross a cop off.
            More precisely an ex cop. I also have good reason to believe he is a
            native of this town. If not then he's been a resident for a long
            time. Long one. I say this because he knows his way around the city.
            He knows where to dump them bodies. That we know. He kills them
            somewhere then dumps their bodies at these sites. The speed at which
            he does this attests to his high profile because he's someone that
            has a reliable means of getting around. Another possibility is that
            his job allows him to move around. Think a mailman. Firefighter.
            Railway worker. I would not put a politicians past either. Even a
            driver. Any job that allows easy access to places or allows new
            roads to be discovered. There is a small chance this brother might
            not be working alone. That one is slim though. Killers like him
            usually work alone. Now this man is polite. Calm, gentle. Again we
            all can't help but like him. Whether it's the smile, appearance, or
            his words. He cajoles you somehow. Especially those poor damsels.
            Uses his intelligence to his advantage, plays the part until he gets
            what he wants. Now these girls, it's been six girls now. All between
            eighteen to twenty seven years. Apart from their education level and
            age, Connection them is still virtually impossible. I figure they
            might not even be connected. Could be just luck of draw. Now to the
            way he kills them, very violent. Animalistic even but remember"

            bitch. This violent yet remorseful nature is something I would link
            his childhood. Not that he's particularly inflicting hate on this
            women when he does. In fact I have reason to believe when he's
            committing he's not thinking about them. Something in his past he
            can't control. Takes over. Then remorse after. Almost Like a teenage
            boy who feels back after jerking off. Except no traces of sexual
            activity. Well, only one is exception. Rosa. Rosa was special to
            him. Still can't fully put my fingers on why. Even though it was
            after her death. You were still able to get it up. Maybe you wanted
            it, or she was she the only one that was your type. Most
            importantly, despite the perfect physique, good finance and
            charisma. I believe he has one huge shortcoming. One he doesn't want
            to people to know. The one he's protecting with his life. One I
            think he killed Penelope for, He's impotent.”
