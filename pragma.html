                I don’t know why they won’t get more help. If we could just get
                a couple more hands on this, I know mere kids with brain bigger
                than those sheriffs combined. But it’s an evil world we live in.
                The ones with the brains do jobs meant for the brawn. Wasting
                away good brain. Like Rosa, she took my order down without
                putting pen to paper and even did the math in her head. I reckon
                she could help solve one or two of these cases. Everything
                served by her hand is so delicious even though I don’t like the
                food. I could go back today, After Bedford.

                "Oh Bedford" It’s the third one now, well that we know of. But
                Bedford is a different ground, not even close to the first two
                ones. We could have two killers? The method of killing are very
                similar, I haven’t seen the body in Bedford but M told me it’s
                the same, blunt force trauma to the skull and throat slash, Ear
                to ear. but they are far apart enough to be one person. What
                kind of women are they, I need to see the Bedford body. Those
                poor damsels. What fucks me up the most? This bastard is a
                brother. The truth everyone else is perhaps too bewildered to
                utter. I for one am relieved though they call me a mad man, if
                this be a white man, we will eternally be bounded… worse
                identified with him. And God help us who live on pain because he
                will be our god all over again. So I rejoice we hurt ourselves.
                At least it is we who hurt us. And It is we who will lick our
                wounds when pain is gone.

                Matilda glares up at Pragma. She sticks up her middle finger as

              <span>THE NEXT DAY</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                It's a warm afternoon outside the Atlanta police department.

              <br />
              <span>
                Pragma is standing in front of a newly constructed conference
                room that is slowly filling up with officers.

              <span>
                One of the men sitting in the back blurt out immediately
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>"Speak up kid"</span>
              <br />
              <span>Pragma glares at him sharply</span>
              <br />
              <span>Pragma repeats immediately, in a slightly hushed tone</span>
              <br />
              <span>The man responds sharply</span>
              <br />
              <span>"What the fuck did you say?"</span>
              <br />
              <span>PRAGMA</span>
              <br />
              <span>"Ahhh, heard me this time looks like."</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                A slim tall figure in front of the conference room interjects
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "These men are here to listen to what you gots to say so do not
                be a smart ass, the real evil to catch is out there."
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>He sharply points outside.</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                Pragma quickly but slowly nods towards at the tall man in front
                of the room who is now staring straight ahead. Ignoring Pragma.
              </span>

              <span>PRAGMA</span>
              <br />
              <span>"Ahem."</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "As you fine folks are all aware, a new victim was unearthed
                yesterday. Body of twenty-two year old Rosa Trice. Rosa was a
                waitress at the diner just a few blocks left of Bedford. The one
                we was just at."
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                Pragma pauses as he puts his right hand on his hip and the other
                on his forehead.
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "What? couple days ago?. Some of y’all may know her. She served
                that evening."
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                Some of the officers drop their head and mutter quietly.
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>"Which one again?"</span>
              <br />
              <span>The man in the back mutters while he looks at Pragma.</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                A few of the officers turn around and look at him with a mix of
                embarrassment and shame.
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>"What, they look the same,"</span>
              <br />
              <span>He says laughingly.</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "It's not my blame they got on the same clothes and hair, and
                face, and nose. No, the nose is always different"
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                It's the man in front of the room again, this time he's speaking
                with anger.
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>"Up, now."</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "What? Just giving the kid some valid information for the
                investigation"
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "Get the fuck out of my fucking conference room Ovlav. You are a
                fucking stupid piece of shit. Out. Now."
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                There is movement in the back of the room moments later.
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                Pragma clears his throat as the door to the conference room
                close.
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "So far he has now dropped three poor damsels, it pleases me to
                tell you all that we have a serial killer on our hands."
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>"What that is?"</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                A short officer sitting close across from Pragma asks.
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                Pragma rests his hand on his forehead. He continues on.
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "A term for a killer responsible for two or more series of
                murders. Do you like the name?"
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>"Umm. No."</span>
              <br />
              <span>The officer hisses. His cheeks visibly red.</span>
              <br />
              <span>"So what is this serial killer business?"</span>
              <br />
              <span>The tall slim man sharply interjects.</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "Why is he special than that nut in the cell right down there?"
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>He points past Pragma with his eyebrows.</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                Pragma’s eyes light up. He turns towards the man who now has his
                hands folded over his crossed legs.
              </span>
              <br />

              <br />
              <span>
                "It is not because he’s too strong and his rage won this time
                while beating his wife. No, no. Or because he got drunk on his
                loaded rifle he got on his poor waist too big for him anyways.
                Oh God no."
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "See officer, what worries me is he’s a learned man. One that
                knows the way of the land. He’s trained in a craft that does
                good, a man that’s been around, cultured, primed. What worries
                my heart at night officer is this man doesn’t have to be big or
                have rage too big for him. You know, I don’t think he has
                either."

              <br />
              <span>
                One of pragma’s left finger points out in objection then follows
                identically with his right.

              <br />
              <span>
                "But officer, I fear when I think about this man because I know
                he has more brain than all of us here combined. Now ain’t mean
                to talk crudely to none of y’all and y’all’s brain but he got
                all of us beat here. So you ask me why he’s so special than the
                nut in the cell right over from us? I’ll tell you why,"
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                Pragma looks towards where the tall slim man was pointing to
                earlier as he puts his left hand on his hip and then reaches
                into his pocket. He grabs his watch.
              </span>

              <span>
                "He’s slashing a young woman as we speak. She’s nothing around
                sixteen to twenty-five. She works a job that’s late at night.
                Poor girl was tired, just wanted to go home and rest up, but
                that poor man just looked lost and sad. Spoke to me nicely too.
                What kind of lady am I if I don’t indulge him."
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>"But what fucks me up the most you see,"</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "Men like him the ones those poor damsels can’t help but fall
                prey to. He knows them, so he just pokes and pushes them till he
                finds it fun no longer. Then he throws them away. For us to
                find."

              <br />
              <span>"See hold on now,"</span>
              <br />
              <span>The short man in the hat forcefully grunts</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "If he so smart why you here? begging us to help you?"
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                Pragma chuckles looking at the man in the chair on his right.

              <br />
              <span>
                The double door to the large conference room suddenly springs
                wide open
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>MATILDA</span>
              <br />
              <span>"Pragma, it's for you."</span>
              <br />
              <span>Matilda puts her hand close to her ear</span>

              <br />
              <span>
                Matilda drops her shoulders, her hand follows as she curses
                under her breath
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>MATILDA</span>

              <span>"It’s Constantine."</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                Pragma rearranges his suit. He turns to the tall slim man on his
                left.
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>“Pardon me, I have to take this.”</span>
              <br />
              <span>OFFICER</span>
              <br />
              <span>“Go on son.”</span>
              <br />
              <span>He nods.</span>
              <br />
              <span>Pragma steps out of the room with Matilda.</span>
              <br />
              <span>PRAGMA</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "So did she say what’s so troubling she could not wait till
                after?"
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>Matilda's eyes widen surprisingly.</span>
              <br />
              <span>MATILDA</span>
              <br />
              <span>"I don’t fucking know! That’s your wife.”</span>
              <br />
              <span>Matilda says coldly.</span>
              <br />
              <span>“Ol' lady just says she wants to talk to you."</span>
              <br />
              <span>MATILDA</span>
              <br />
              <span>"Pragma"</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                Matilda softly says as she touches Pragma on his arms stopping
                him in his tracks.
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>MATILDA</span>
              <br />
              <span>"She sounds sick. What’s wrong."</span>
              <br />
              <span>Pragma looks down and grabs Matilda by her arm.</span>
              <br />
              <span>PRAGMA</span>
              <br />
              <span>"Matilda"</span>
              <br />
              <span>Pragma responds softly, with worry in his tone.</span>
              <br />
              <span>PRAGMA</span>
              <br />
              <span>"Will you please shut the fuck up."</span>
              <br />
              <span>Matilda jerks away</span>
              <br />
              <span>MATILDA</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "It’s simple, a retard. Still has bitter and mean as back then.
                The phone is down the hall by the cell."
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>Pragma nods</span>
              <br />
              <span>MATILDA</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "You said cracker in there before I opened the door, Do you
                think he is white?"
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>Pragma chuckles as he closes the door behind Matilda.</span>
              <br />
              <span>PRAGMA</span>
              <br />
              <span>"No."</span>
              <br />
              <span>PRAGMA (on the phone)</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "Oh, I was so shocked Constantine. I went to Bedford place
                yesterday. It was Horror. But I'm holding on Constantine, I'm
                holding on.”
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>Pragma stutters as he grabs the phone tighter.</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "So what is it, Babushka? You know, this time of the day ain't
                really a good time for me to talk to my dear."
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                Constantine who has been silent slowly starts sobbing.
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>"Pragma."</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "Hold on now, is that tears I hear, my dear what’s the matter?"
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                Pragma says ever so softly as he subtly checks his watch.
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>CONSTANTINE</span>
              <br />
              <span>"I went there today."</span>
              <br />
              <span>"Where?"</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                Pragma's arms drop remembering where Constantine went.
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "I told you not to go there alone, Dear. Why? Why did you go
                without me?"
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>CONSTANTINE</span>
              <br />
              <span>"Dear...dear...dear..."</span>
              <br />
              <span>Constantine trails off.</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "All the sweet words, except you never here. Never fucking here
                when I need you. But the blue bodies got your attention huh?”
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                Constantine's voice breaks as she asks. after a few moments of
                silence on the line, Constantine continues bitterly.
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>CONSTANTINE</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "It's even no use, I forget who I'm talking to. The fool over
                there just nodding and checking his watch."
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>Pragma swallows bitterly. He slowly responds</span>
              <br />
              <span>PRAGMA</span>
              <br />
              <span>"My dear, can we- Ahem."</span>
              <br />
              <span>He clears his throat.</span>
              <br />
              <span>"I reckon we talk about this later."</span>
              <br />
              <span>CONSTANTINE</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "Oh fuck you nigga. Why? because M said so? Working for crackers
                enough as is, now they got the poor nigger listening to a white
                bitch."
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                With his left hand on his forehead and pain in his tone, he
                responds.
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>PRAGMA</span>
              <br />

                "I'm almost home my dear, I'm almost home. Just hold on for me.
                Do that for me?"
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>Constantine softly responds.</span>
              <br />
              <span>CONSTANTINE</span>
              <br />
              <span>"Yes, I will."</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                Her sobbing growing loud now. At the same time, the door to the
                hallway opens again. He looks up.
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>PRAGMA</span>
              <br />
              <span>"I got to go now, my dear."</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                Matilda yells from the hallway without fully walking to Pragma.
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "Pragma, the sheriffs found something. We need to leave."
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>Constantine curses on the line.</span>
              <br />
              <span>CONSTANTINE</span>
              <br />
              <span>"There go your boss."</span>
              <br />
              <span>MATILDA</span>
              <br />
              <span>"Now."</span>
              <br />
              <span>Constantine hisses. The line cuts.</span>
              <br />
              <span>PRAGMA</span>
              <br />
              <span>"My ears work, M."</span>
              <br />
              <span>MATILDA</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "That's great, I need your legs to work too because we've got to
                move. Now."
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>Matilda responds and closes the door.</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                Some seconds of silence pass then a raspy voice inside the cell
                across the phone stall begins to mutter something under his
                breath.
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>pragma looks across.</span>
              <br />
              <span>PRAGMA</span>
              <br />
              <span>"What did you say?"</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                The man's voice is still raspy as he steps closer to the bars of
                the cell. he whispers,
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>RASPY VOICE</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                "Looks to me like you have some lady issues on your hands."
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                Pragma looks at the man. He smiles as he looks away and finally
                hangs the phone back.
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>PRAGMA</span>
              <br />
              <span>"You are a funny man."</span>
              <br />
              <span>His smile quickly fades as he makes for the door.</span>
