            "Well, I'm almost sure he's a brother. I place him middle aged. Late
            thirties to early forties. He’s fairly built. Well above average
            height. In other sense quite an attractive man. He's also smart.
            Therefore his job is respectable. Also high income. In addition to
            that, it's admirable or high profile. He's someone we all might have
            seen. Someone we all like. Think our friendly mailman, cop,
            firefighter, family doctor, teacher. I won't even cross a cop off.
            More precisely an ex cop. I also have good reason to believe he is a
            native of this town. If not then he's been a resident for a long
            time. Long one. I say this because he knows his way around the city.
            He knows where to dump them bodies. That we know. He kills them
            somewhere then dumps their bodies at these sites. The speed at which
            he does this attests to his high profile because he's someone that
            has a reliable means of getting around. Another possibility is that
            his job allows him to move around. Think a mailman. Firefighter.
            Railway worker. I would not put a politicians past either. Even a
            driver. Any job that allows easy access to places or allows new
            roads to be discovered. There is a small chance this brother might
            not be working alone. That one is slim though. Killers like him
            usually work alone. Now this man is polite. Calm, gentle. Again we
            all can't help but like him. Whether it's the smile, appearance, or
            his words. He cajoles you somehow. Especially those poor damsels.
            Uses his intelligence to his advantage, plays the part until he gets
            what he wants. Now these girls, it's been six girls now. All between
            eighteen to twenty seven years. Apart from their education level and
            age, Connection them is still virtually impossible. I figure they
            might not even be connected. Could be just luck of draw. Now to the
            way he kills them, very violent. Animalistic even but remember"

            Like Rosa and the first three. He gently placed them at the scene
            neatly. Almost like he hasn't just killed them. that sick son of a
            bitch. This violent yet remorseful nature is something I would link
            his childhood. Not that he's particularly inflicting hate on this
            women when he does. In fact I have reason to believe when he's
            committing he's not thinking about them. Something in his past he
            can't control. Takes over. Then remorse after. Almost Like a teenage
            boy who feels back after jerking off. Except no traces of sexual
            activity. Well, only one is exception. Rosa. Rosa was special to
            him. Still can't fully put my fingers on why. Even though it was
            after her death. You were still able to get it up. Maybe you wanted
            it, or she was she the only one that was your type. Most
            importantly, despite the perfect physique, good finance and
            charisma. I believe he has one huge shortcoming. One he doesn't want
            to people to know. The one he's protecting with his life. One I

            Pragma mutters under his breath but loud enough for Matilda to hear.
            she was paces ahead. She finally stops by a bridge a few yards just
            around the School. Pragma stayed by the car taking in the view of
            the clear sky. It was dark already but the lights of the city below
            made it a view. The chilly air that blew made Matilda shiver. Pragma
            makes his way over to her

            Pragma waves his hands dramatically over the clear city. Matilda is
            quiet after a few silent moment Pragma puts his jacket around her
