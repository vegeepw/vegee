          <p class="sipping-out-the">“you don’t” she hesitates</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">“but it’s true”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">
            i wrap my hands around her waist, i felt her body softly quiver then
            she pulled me closer wrapping herself around the rest of me she
            could fit
          </p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">
            our eyes meet and time took pity, slowing a little as i basked into
            her eyes
          </p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">“you did”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">she said to me</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">“I would never do that to you”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">I said to her but she said it first</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">breaking our gaze</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">“shut up and kiss me”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">she pulls me closer</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">“are you ready?”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">“ready?” i repeat</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">
            just as we made a wide turn she slides into my mouth tongue first
          </p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">“stop” I said after a few</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">she stops with a frown</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">
            still bound by saliva while breathing heavily into each other, my
            lower face now smeared by your black lipstick i whispered
          </p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">“i’m only here for work”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">
            “really?” she brings her face to the bulge that’s now grown up my
            jeans
          </p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">i pause flustered</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">that can’t be helped, you did that</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">she giggles sheepishly</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">“let me help you”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">
            she starts unbuckling my belt. i reach to stop her this time.
          </p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">“What” visibly upset now</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">“won’t he”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">i motion to the front</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">“you are making too much noise”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">
            “I pay him to hear what i want him to hear”
          </p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">she kissed it first</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">a “Mhmm” escaped</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">she asked again</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">“who are you?”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">she didn’t come back up this time</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">i felt my legs clamp</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">“i am”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">
            my face catches something outside before i could finish
          </p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">bewildered</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">“is that your name on a street?”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">she only squealed back</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the">i sigh and shake my head</p>
          <p class="shit-wrong-animal">my arm drops on the sparkle arm rest</p>
