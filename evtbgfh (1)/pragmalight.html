            I don’t know why they won’t get more help. If we could just get a
            couple more hands on this, I know mere kids with brain bigger than
            those sheriffs combined. But it’s an evil world we live in. The ones
            with the brains do jobs meant for the brawn. Wasting away good
            brain. Like Rosa, she took my order down without putting pen to
            paper and even did the math in her head. I reckon she could help
            solve one or two of these cases. Everything served by her hand is so
            delicious even though I don’t like the food. I could go back today,
            After Bedford.

            "Oh Bedford" It’s the third one now, well that we know of. But
            Bedford is a different ground, not even close to the first two ones.
            We could have two killers? The method of killing are very similar, I
            haven’t seen the body in Bedford but M told me it’s the same, blunt
            force trauma to the skull and throat slash, Ear to ear. but they are
            far apart enough to be one person. What kind of women are they, I
            need to see the Bedford body. Those poor damsels. What fucks me up
            the most? This bastard is a brother. The truth everyone else is
            perhaps too bewildered to utter. I for one am relieved though they
            call me a mad man, if this be a white man, we will eternally be
            bounded… worse identified with him. And God help us who live on pain
            because he will be our god all over again. So I rejoice we hurt
            ourselves. At least it is we who hurt us. And It is we who will lick
            our wounds when pain is gone.
