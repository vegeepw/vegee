          <p class="i-dont-know4">I could almost make out the smell </p>
          <p class="i-dont-know4">I know I stumbled on it</p>
          <p class="i-dont-know4">We were driving back to your hometown </p>
          <p class="i-dont-know4">It was late, nighttime</p>

            The pretty leaves and tall rocks have now settled to bed

          <p class="i-dont-know4">They’re still tall although not as pretty</p>

          <p class="i-dont-know4">
            Like if the tall rocks and pretty trees took it off and put it on me

          <p class="i-dont-know4">My knees would probably fold</p>
          <p class="i-dont-know4">But that’s okay,</p>
