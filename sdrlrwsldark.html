            throwing herself into my lap she giggles
          </p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">she reached for my cheek</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">“why are you here?”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">“umm”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">“I don’t”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">“I don’t know”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">i lunge forward</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">“stop”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">she puts one finger to my chest</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">
            snarling yards away from her lips i roll my eyes
          </p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">“stop what?”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">“i love you”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">i said again</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">“you don’t” she hesitates</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">“but it’s true”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">
            i wrap my hands around her waist, i felt her body softly quiver then
            she pulled me closer wrapping herself around the rest of me she
            could fit
          </p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">
            our eyes meet and time took pity, slowing a little as i basked into
            her eyes
          </p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">“you did”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">she said to me</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">“I would never do that to you”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">I said to her but she said it first</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">breaking our gaze</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">“shut up and kiss me”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">she pulls me closer</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">“are you ready?”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">“ready?” i repeat</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">
            just as we made a wide turn she slides into my mouth tongue first
          </p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">“stop” I said after a few</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">she stops with a frown</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">
            still bound by saliva while breathing heavily into each other, my
            lower face now smeared by your black lipstick i whispered
          </p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">“i’m only here for work”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">
            “really?” she brings her face to the bulge that’s now grown up my
            jeans
          </p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">i pause flustered</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">that can’t be helped, you did that</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">she giggles sheepishly</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">“let me help you”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">
            she starts unbuckling my belt. i reach to stop her this time.
          </p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">“What” visibly upset now</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">“won’t he”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">i motion to the front</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">“you are making too much noise”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">
            “I pay him to hear what i want him to hear”
          </p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">she kissed it first</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">a “Mhmm” escaped</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">she asked again</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">“who are you?”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">she didn’t come back up this time</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">i felt my legs clamp</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">“i am”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">
            my face catches something outside before i could finish
          </p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">bewildered</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">“is that your name on a street?”</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">she only squealed back</p>
          <p class="sipping-out-the1">i sigh and shake my head</p>
          <p class="shit-wrong-animal1">my arm drops on the sparkle arm rest</p>
